I'm Hoang, a backend-focused Software Engineer with strong experience in building large-scale systems. Specialized in high-concurrency, low-latency cloud-native infrastructures and performance optimization. Delivered products that serves millions of users.

I'm currently pursuing my M.S. in CS at GMU, where I’m gonna explore database technologies, distributed systems, scalable software design and learning things the hard way. 

Always happy to connect, discuss about tech and related areas.
